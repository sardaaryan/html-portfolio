<h3>Home Alone</h3>
<p>This is my favorite childhood movie because I always watch it during Christmas to get in the festive spirit.</p>
<h3>How High</h3>
<p>I love this movie cause this marked the start of my 420 friendly attitude as well as giving me an open mind.</p>
<h3>Dude, Where's My Car?</h3>
<p>This movie is one of my favorites because of how creatively stupid yet genius the whole thing is lol.</p>
